Summary
=======

Parslither is a hex editor with a twist: It supports binary templates that display the parsed file contents in the bottom pane.
Eventually it will support highlighting the different fields in the hex editor like 010 Editor.

The code's a little dated (it's from 2011) and inefficient but it still works fine.

Pre-requisites
==============

* PyQt4
* Construct
* Yapsy
* Python-Magic
* qhexedit2
